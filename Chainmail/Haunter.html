	<h2>Haunter</h2>
	<p>Yes, another pokemon.  This Haunter was a crutial test of my ability to work with the anodized titanium wire I got from The Ring Lord.
	Besides what has become the standard steel and aluminum wire, this piece encorporates "violet" and "rose" colored anodized titanium and I think the effect works quite well.
	</p>
	<p>The only feature that didn't come across right were Haunter's pupils, which I merely removed (replaced with aluminum rings).</p>
