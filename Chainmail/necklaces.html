	<p>I initially started making this necklace because I had an excess of a couple thousand plain brass rings after finishing the swirl.
	It is a simple 4:1 weave torus of width 4.</p>

	<h2>Necklace 2</h2>
	<p>My first necklace received enough praise that I decided to make a follow up necklace for my wife's birthday.
	I used the new rods I bought to make larger rings, which are needed to capture the quartz marbles in each strand.</p>
