			<img src="Chainmail/fleur de lis.thumb.jpg">
			<h3>Fluer de Lis</h3>
			<p>My first piece.  I wanted to do something martial, yet somewhat ornate.  I thought a fleur de lis was appropriate.</p>
			<p>This piece has 5989 rings and is composed of 22 gauge copper and dark annealed steel wire.  It uses a 4:1 European weave (which was the only weave I knew at the time).
			Notice the ARM signature in the bottom right corner.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/Charizard.thumb.jpg">
			<h3>Charizard</h3>
			<p>This piece is my attempt to test how well finer details come out.  Fortunately, pokemon in the old gameboy pokemon games only use 4 colors.
			This Charizard specifically has white, black, red, and orange (rendered in galvanized steel, dark annealed steel, copper, and brass respectively). </p>
			<p>I think the details came out wonderfully.  In fact this is still one of my favorite pieces.
			It is very similar to the fleur de lis in scope: 6498 rings, uses a 4:1 weave.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/swirl.thumb.jpg">
			<h3>Swirl</h3>
			<p>This time intensive piece has 2<sup>16</sup> (65536) rings and uses a 6:1 European weave.  5 colors are used to get the grayscale effect: aluminum, plain brass, 2 types of anodized brass, and dark annealed steel.</p>
			<p>The design is based on a genetic pattern originally made for a calendar for my family.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/Haunter.thumb.jpg">
			<h3>Haunter</h3>
			<p>Yes, another pokemon.  This Haunter was a crucial test of my ability to work with the anodized titanium wire I got from The Ring Lord.
			Besides what has become the standard steel and aluminum wire, this piece incorporates "violet" and "rose" colored anodized titanium and I think the effect works quite well.
			</p>
			<p>The only feature that didn't come across right were Haunter's pupils, which I merely removed (replaced with aluminum rings).

	<h2> Necklaces </h2>
		
	<div class="thumbscroll">
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 1.thumb.jpg">
			<p>I initially started making this necklace because I had an excess of a couple thousand plain brass rings after finishing the swirl.
			It is a simple 4:1 weave torus of width 4.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 2.thumb.jpg">
			<p>My first necklace received enough praise that I decided to make a follow up necklace for my wife's birthday.
			I used the new rods I bought to make larger rings, which are needed to capture the quartz marbles in each strand.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 4.thumb.jpg">
			<p> A simple necklace (the same as my first) with gradient from brass to black steel.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 5.thumb.jpg">
			<p> This necklace is an experiment in the effect of increasing ring size towards the edge.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 6.thumb.jpg">
			<p> I started randomly making a cylinder of Dragon mail and decided it reminded me of a snake.
			So I made a head and tail to match.
			The tongue is actually a toggle clasp that fits into the end ring of the tail.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 7.thumb.jpg">
			<p> A variant on my first necklace, this one is a 6:1 weave torus of width 3 made of aluminum. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 10.thumb.jpg">
			<p> The pendant is a Hamiltonian cycle of a tesseract, and the chain is a simple box weave, both in black steel. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/necklace 11.thumb.jpg">
			<p> As a gift for my mother I experimented with incorporating beads (jade in this case) into a necklace. </p>

	<h2> Earrings </h2>
		
	<div class="thumbscroll">
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 1.thumb.jpg">
			<p> These are supposed to pair with the necklace also with captured marbles. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 2.thumb.jpg">
			<p> A small piece of Dragon mail with a gradient. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 3.thumb.jpg">
			<p> Also Dragon mail, these earrings pair with the snake necklace. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 4.thumb.jpg">
			<p> This pair is an experiment with using differenlty sized rings.
			The form of these earrrings is maintained by the tension due to the central piece of wire and since wire does not do well under compression, these are rather delicate. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 5.thumb.jpg">
			<p> Each earring is a Hamiltonian cycle of a dodecahedron, made entirely by hand. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 6.thumb.jpg">
			<p> Dragon mail earrings with a simple pattern.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 7.thumb.jpg">
			<p> Small box weave earrings with concentric rings at the bottom. </p>

		<div class="thumb">
			<img src="Chainmail/earrings 8.thumb.jpg">
			<p> An experiment trying to incorporate beads (red jade this time) into a pair of earrings. </p>
