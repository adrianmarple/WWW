	<p>Some time around May 2013 I had the urge to do something with my hands.  After returning from a couple mile walk I resolved to revive an idea I had back in high school: make images in chainmail using differently colored metal.
		To this day I haven't looked back.  My aim is to thoroughly explore this medium, and it will probably be years (if ever) before I run out of ideas. </p>
		
	<p>Feel free to check out the pieces in "chronological" order, or just skip to the latest and often best piece. </p>
	
	<p>On the offhand chance that you are reading this and want to commission a piece, I currently stand firmly in the amateur camp but am willing to change.
	Contact me at adrian.marple@gmail.com and we can discuss feasibility.</p>
