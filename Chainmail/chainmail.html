	<h2>Fleur de Lis</h2>
	<p>My first piece.  I wanted to do something martial, yet somewhat ornate.  I thought a fleur de lis was appropiate.</p>
	<p>This piece has almost 6000 rings and is composed of 22 gauge copper and dark annealed steel wire.  It uses a 4:1 European weave (which was the only weave I knew at the time).</p>
</div>
<div id="Charizard" class="box">
	<img src="Chainmail/Charizard.jpg" alt="Fleur de Lis" class="left" width="40%">
	<h2>Charizard</h2>
	<p>This piece is my attempt to test how well finer details come out.  Fortunately, pokemon in the old gameboy pokemon games only use 4 colors.
		This Charizard specifically has white, black, red, and orange (rendered in galvanized steel, dark annealed steel, copper, and brass respectively). </p>
	<p>I think the details came out wonderfully.  In fact this is still one of my favorite pieces.
	It is very similar to the fleur de lis in scope: about 6000 rings, uses a 4:1 weave.</p>
</div>
<div id="DoubleHelix" class="box">
	<img src="Chainmail/double helix.jpg" alt="Double Helix" class="right" width="40%">
	<h2>Double Helix</h2>
	<p>An experimental 3D piece.  The two helices have a grandient from red to white (transitioning from copper, to bronze, to brass, to steel).</p>
	<p>I haven't quite decided the best way to hang this one, but I will update the picture when I get some better placement.</p>
	<p>Still a 4:1 weave.</p>
</div>
<div id="Swirl" class="box">
	<img src="Chainmail/swirl.jpg" alt="Swirl" class="left" width="40%">
	<h2>Swirl</h2>
	<p>Still unfinished.  But the rings are assembled.</p>
	<p>This time intensive piece has 2<sup>16</sup> (65536) rings and uses a 6:1 European weave.  5 colors are used to get the greyscale effect: aluminum, plain brass, 2 types of anodized brass, and dark annealed steel.</p>
	<p>The design is based on a genetic pattern originally made for a calendar for my family.</p>
