	<p> The goal of this project is to make clicking on links (and other clickable html elements) easier.
	This is done by guiding the mouse pointer closer to links than it would normally go.
	However, JavaScript cannot actually move the mouse pointer.
	To get around this the real pointer is hidden and a fake one is put up.

	<p>Hit crtl-q to toggle gravity on and off.
	I am currently working on a chrome extension for this, which will be available when it is more stable
