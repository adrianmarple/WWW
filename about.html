	<p>My name is Adrian de Ruyter Marple.
	As a true autodidact, this website is designed to showcase anything of interest that I've figured out how to do.
	If you're looking for a short bio/CV blurb, well, I was born in Holland (although I am a US citizen only).
	Raised, in silicon valley I went to Los Altos High School, then UC Berkeley for EECS, and finally Stanford for their CS PhD program.
	I am currently on leave of absence from Stanford, although I was conferred a Master's in passing.</p>
	
	<!-- <p>My interests?  Besides all the Math/CS stuff you see here, I have a steadily smoldering passion for music.
	I have some very strong and almost universally unconventional opinions about music.
	</p> -->
