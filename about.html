	<p>My name is Adrian de Ruyter Marple.  I was born in Holland (although I am a US citizen only).
	Raised in the Silicon Valley, I went to Los Altos High School, then UC Berkeley for EECS, and finally Stanford for their CS PhD program.
	I am currently on leave of absence from Stanford, although I was conferred a Master's in passing.</p>
	
	<p> This website is meant to serve as a showcase for the various projects that I find myself engaged in.
	As you can no doubt tell from the navigation menu to the left, my side projects somewhat neatly dichotomize into coding and art projects.
	For the time being, all of the showcased coding projects are written in JavaScript (including the rotating polytopes throughout the site), but this is only because that is my most recent language of preference (and because JavaScript projects are easier to display on the internet).
	However, I've been in the practice of engaging in these types of projects long before I knew how to code in JavaScript.
	In fact, HexSweeper was originally coded in C++ and OpenGL.
	I've also written a few screen-scraping bots, most notably a freecell playing bot (written in Java), but these are either not appropriate or not easy to convey on this website.
	<!-- On another semi-hacking note, with the aid of scripts I managed to procure 5TB of literal space and 5PB (thats 1,000 terabytes) of theoretical cloud storage space with <a href="https://copy.com?r=GK0hIw" target="_blank">Copy</a>.
	-->
	</p>
	
	<p> On the other hand, there are my art projects.
	The music I started in the summer of 2011 when I decided that I missed music, although going back to playing trumpet was not really an option (I had played trumpet for 12 years and quit after getting my BS).
	I naturally found myself gravitating towards writing video game style music, both because of the midi playback and because that's what my ears wanted to hear.
	My composing, amateur as it is, has influences from Nobuo Uematsu, Phillip Glass, John Adams, Blotted Science, and Animals as Leaders, to name a few.
	The chainmail art started as a way for me to do something with my hands, sometime around May 2013.
	I initially only started doing inlays, but gradually gravitated to making jewellery.
	</p>
	
	<p>Of the things you won't find on this website, perhaps my greatest interest is weight lifting.
	In fact one of the biggest reasons I'm living in my current apartment is because it had the best gym of all that we had looked at.
	I more often than not work out solo, but I'm always glad to have a work-out buddy.
	</p>
	
	<p>I would also like to mention my wife, Annie, who is an English teacher at Milpitas High School, and my sister, Mieke, who co-owns a gallery in LA (<a href="http://www.nightgallery.ca" target="_blank">www.nightgallery.ca</a>).
