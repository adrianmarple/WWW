		<p class="thought">A scrollbar for thumbnails that packs a infinite scroll into a finite area.  Midpoints given by logistic function and size given by a Gaussian.</p>
		<p class="thought">Gamify sleep.  Give rewards for consistency and duration.  Use something like a sleep app to gather ground truth data.</p>
		<p class="thought">Turn the recruitment puzzle on its head.  Send prospective employers a (web-based) puzzle to solve that gives my contact info at the end.</p> 
		<p class="thought">Gamify chores.  Use the power of the chain of Xs idea to help form habits.</p>
		<p class="thought">Give clickable items on the screen gravity: a "force" that increases mouse speed based on proximity.</p>
		<p class="thought">Make a script that gets dropbox referrals through Mechanical Turk.  Advertise through Craig's List perhaps and charge e.g. $20.  Eventually perhaps set up a website to process payments and start script automatically.</p>
		<p class="thought">Make an app (or at least website) that records thoughts in this html file.  Maybe use dropbox API.</p>
		<p class="thought">OLD THOUGHT: 3D printed diamond.</p>
		<p class="thought">OLD THOUGHT: Cross between MOOC and P90X: a continuous online workout class.  Perhaps target women more with classes like yoga and pilattes.</p>
		<p class="thought">OLD THOUGHT: High fidelity 3D displays.  Track eyes and adaptively change focus based on eye position.  More suited for video games.</p>
		<p class="thought">OLD THOUGHT: Eyes as mouse. Ease of access idea that turns blinks into clicks and focal point into mouse position.</p>
